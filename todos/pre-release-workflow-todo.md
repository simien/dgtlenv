## üîÑ Pre-Release Workflow

### Standard Release Process

1. **Pre-Sanitization Check**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --dry-run
   ```

2. **Apply Sanitization Fixes**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --fix
   ```

3. **Verify Fixes**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --dry-run
   ```

4. **Review Report**
   ```bash
   cat logs/sanitization-report-*.md
   ```

5. **Final Security Check**
   ```bash
   # Manual verification
   grep -r "sap\|/Users/" . --exclude-dir=.git
   grep -r "api_key\|password\|token" . --exclude-dir=.git
   ```

6. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: sanitize personal information for release"
   git push origin main
   ```
