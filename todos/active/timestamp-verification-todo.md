# Timestamp Verification Todo (Optional)

> **Note:** This check is optional and can be run after the initial GitHub launch. It is not required for repository publication or core functionality.

## 🕒 Timestamp Check Task

### Background
The repository had inconsistent timestamps between:
- **2025-07-25** (July 25, 2025) - Correct current date
- **2025-01-25** (January 25, 2025) - Incorrect old date

### ✅ Fixed Files
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] `SECURITY_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md`
- [x] `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [x] `scripts/README.md`
- [x] `github-setup.md`
- [x] `security.md`

### 🔍 Remaining Check
- [x] **Run timestamp verification** ✅ COMPLETED 2025-07-28
  ```bash
   grep -r "2025-01-25\|Jan 25" . --include="*.md" --include="*.sh" --include="*.yml" --include="*.json" | grep -v ".git" || echo "✅ All timestamps are now correct!"
   ```

### 📋 Quick Check Commands
```bash
# Fast check for specific files
grep "2025-01-25" CHANGELOG.md security.md CONTRIBUTING.md

# Check only recent files
find . -name "*.md" -mtime -1 | xargs grep "2025-01-25" 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ Recent files are clean"

# Check only specific directories
grep -r "2025-01-25" .github/ scripts/ docs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ Key directories are clean"
```

### 🎯 Priority
- **Low Priority** - Most critical files already fixed
- **Can be run later** when system resources are available
- **Not blocking** for GitHub push
