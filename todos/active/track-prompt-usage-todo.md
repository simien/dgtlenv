## üéØ **Overview**

This task involves implementing a comprehensive system for tracking prompt usage and performance across the DgtlEnv prompt management system.

### **Background**
- Tracking prompt usage can provide valuable insights into which prompts are most effective and which need improvement
- Current system lacks detailed analytics on prompt performance and user feedback
- Usage data can help optimize prompt selection and improve user experience

### **Objectives**
- [ ] Log which prompts are used and how often
- [ ] Track the feedback received for each prompt
- [ ] Generate reports on prompt usage and performance
- [ ] Implement analytics dashboard for prompt insights
- [ ] Create feedback collection mechanisms

---

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Logging Infrastructure**
- [ ] Implement logging of prompt usage in the relevant scripts
- [ ] Create structured log format for prompt interactions
- [ ] Set up log aggregation and storage system
- [ ] Implement prompt usage tracking in `run-prompt.sh` and `run-prompt-enhanced.sh`

### **Phase 2: Feedback Collection**
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback on prompts
- [ ] Create feedback forms and rating systems
- [ ] Integrate feedback collection into prompt execution workflow
- [ ] Set up feedback storage and categorization

### **Phase 3: Analytics & Reporting**
- [ ] Generate reports on prompt usage and performance
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard for prompt insights
- [ ] Implement performance metrics and trends analysis
- [ ] Set up automated reporting and alerts

### **Phase 4: Integration & Optimization**
- [ ] Integrate usage data with prompt selection algorithms
- [ ] Implement prompt performance scoring
- [ ] Create recommendation system based on usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize prompt routing based on analytics

## üöÄ **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Access prompt analytics
./scripts/prompt-analytics.sh

# View prompt usage reports
./scripts/prompt-analytics.sh --report usage

# Check prompt performance metrics
./scripts/prompt-analytics.sh --report performance

# Generate feedback summary
./scripts/prompt-analytics.sh --report feedback
```

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### **Completion Criteria**
- [ ] All prompt interactions are logged and tracked
- [ ] Feedback collection system is operational
- [ ] Analytics dashboard provides actionable insights
- [ ] Performance reports are generated automatically
- [ ] Usage data improves prompt selection

### **Quality Checks**
- [ ] Logging system captures 100% of prompt interactions
- [ ] Feedback collection has >80% user participation
- [ ] Analytics provide clear insights for optimization
- [ ] Performance metrics are accurate and reliable
