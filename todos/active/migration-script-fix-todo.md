## ðŸ“‹ Migration Script Fixes

### Critical Issues to Fix

- [x] **Fix early exit bug in main loop**
  - [x] Replace `return $migrated_count` in `process_completed_file` function
  - [x] Use echo to return values instead of return statements
  - [x] Update main loop to capture output instead of exit code
  - [x] Test that all files are processed, not just the first one

- [x] **Fix migration report generation**
  - [x] Ensure `create_migration_report` function is always called
  - [x] Verify report file is created in `logs/` directory
  - [x] Test report generation with multiple processed files
  - [x] Add error handling for report creation

- [x] **Fix variable scope issues**
  - [x] Make `processed_files` and `total_migrations` global variables
  - [x] Ensure variables are properly updated across function calls
  - [x] Add debug logging for variable values

### Quality Control Improvements

- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling**
  - [ ] Add try-catch equivalent for bash functions
  - [ ] Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Add validation for file operations
  - [ ] Create error reporting system

- [ ] **Improve logging and debugging**
  - [ ] Add debug mode with detailed output
  - [ ] Implement log rotation for large files
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
  - [ ] Create structured log format

- [ ] **Add testing framework**
  - [ ] Create unit tests for individual functions
  - [ ] Add integration tests for full workflow
  - [ ] Implement dry-run validation
  - [ ] Create test data sets

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] **Refactor function design**
  - [ ] Remove side effects from functions
  - [ ] Implement pure functions where possible
  - [ ] Add input validation for all functions
  - [ ] Standardize return value handling

- [ ] **Improve documentation**
  - [ ] Add detailed function documentation
  - [ ] Create usage examples
  - [ ] Document error codes and meanings
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

- [ ] **Performance optimizations**
  - [ ] Optimize file reading operations
  - [ ] Reduce redundant file system calls
  - [ ] Implement batch processing where possible
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Create test scenarios**
  - [ ] Test with empty completed directory
  - [ ] Test with files containing no dynamic symbols
  - [ ] Test with malformed todo files
  - [ ] Test with large numbers of files

- [ ] **Validate migration accuracy**
  - [ ] Verify correct symbol mapping
  - [ ] Test category determination logic
  - [ ] Validate target file creation
  - [ ] Check source file updates

- [ ] **Regression testing**
  - [ ] Test against existing migrated files
  - [ ] Verify no data loss during migration
  - [ ] Test rollback capabilities
  - [ ] Validate backup procedures

### Documentation Updates

- [ ] **Update workflow documentation**
  - [ ] Document the fixed migration process
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Create maintenance procedures
  - [ ] Update related documentation

- [ ] **Create quality control standards**
  - [ ] Define coding standards for bash scripts
  - [ ] Create testing requirements
  - [ ] Establish review processes
  - [ ] Document deployment procedures
