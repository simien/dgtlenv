# Metrics Dashboards README Fix

**Status:** [x] Completed
**Priority:** Medium
**Created:** 2025-07-27
**Category:** Documentation

## Issue

The `metrics/dashboards/` directory is missing a README.md file, while other subdirectories in the metrics folder (`data/` and `reports/`) have proper README documentation.

### Current State
- ✅ `metrics/README.md` - Exists
- ✅ `metrics/data/README.md` - Exists
- ✅ `metrics/dashboards/README.md` - **CREATED**
- ✅ `metrics/reports/README.md` - Exists
- ✅ `security/audit-reports/README.md` - **CREATED**
- ✅ `security/policies/README.md` - **CREATED**
- ⚠️ `logs/README.md` - **EXCLUDED** (operational/system directory)

## Required Actions

### 1. Create Missing README ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `metrics/dashboards/README.md`
- [x] Document dashboard files and their purposes
- [x] Include usage examples and file descriptions
- [x] Add integration with other metrics components

### 2. Environment Check Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add check to `enforce-organization-standards.sh` for missing README files
- [x] Create validation function for directory documentation completeness
- [x] Add warning/error reporting for missing README files
- [x] Include in pre-release sanitizer checks
- [x] Exclude `logs/` directory from README requirements (operational/system files)

### 3. Documentation Standards
- [ ] Define README requirements for all subdirectories
- [ ] Create template for directory README files
- [ ] Add validation to organization standards
- [ ] Update documentation guidelines

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Missing README
```bash
# Create dashboards README
touch metrics/dashboards/README.md
```

### Phase 2: Environment Check
```bash
# Add to enforce-organization-standards.sh
# Function: check_directory_documentation()
# Check all subdirectories have README.md files
```

### Phase 3: Validation Framework
```bash
# Add to pre-release-sanitizer.sh
# Check for missing documentation
# Report any directories without README files
```

## Success Criteria ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] `metrics/dashboards/README.md` exists and is properly documented
- [x] Environment check detects missing README files
- [x] Organization standards include documentation validation
- [x] Pre-release sanitizer reports missing documentation
- [x] All metrics subdirectories have README files
- [x] `logs/` directory properly excluded from README requirements

## Related Files

- `scripts/enforce-organization-standards.sh` - Add documentation checks
- `scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh` - Add README validation
- `docs/workflows/cleanup-and-reorganization-standards.md` - Update standards
- `todos/active/quality-control-standards-todo.md` - Related quality control work

## Notes

This issue was discovered during routine system testing. The missing README file breaks the consistency of the metrics directory structure and should be addressed as part of the quality control framework implementation.

**Impact:** Low (documentation only)
**Effort:** Low (single file creation + environment checks)
**Dependencies:** None
