# CI Test Failure - Resolution Todo

## Issue Summary
- **Date**: July 26, 2025
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Priority**: High
- **Impact**: CI pipeline failing on main branch

## Problem Description
The CI test job was failing due to missing required files. The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` checks for essential project files including `SECURITY.md`, which was missing from the root directory.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing SECURITY.md**: The CI workflow validates that `SECURITY.md` exists in the root directory
2. **Existing Security Structure**: The project has a `security/` directory with comprehensive security documentation
3. **CI Configuration**: The workflow expects a root-level `SECURITY.md` file for standard GitHub repository compliance

## Resolution Actions Taken
- ✅ Created `SECURITY.md` in the root directory
- ✅ Referenced existing `security/` directory structure
- ✅ Included standard security policy template
- ✅ Added links to detailed security documentation

## Files Modified
- `SECURITY.md` (new file)

## Verification Steps
- [x] Verify `SECURITY.md` exists in root directory
- [x] Check that all required CI files are present:
  - [x] README.md
  - [x] CONTRIBUTING.md
  - [x] SECURITY.md
  - [x] CHANGELOG.md
  - [x] LICENSE
  - [x] .gitignore
- [x] Confirm shell script syntax is valid
- [x] Verify shell script permissions are correct

## Prevention Measures
1. **CI Enhancement**: Consider updating CI workflow to be more flexible about security documentation location
2. **Documentation**: Update project setup documentation to include required files
3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Consider adding pre-commit hooks to validate required files

## Related Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI workflow configuration
- `security/` - Existing security documentation directory
- `todos/master-todo.md` - Master todo list

## Notes
- The project already had comprehensive security documentation in the `security/` directory
- The root `SECURITY.md` serves as a standard GitHub repository security policy entry point
- Future CI improvements should consider the existing security documentation structure

## Status
**RESOLVED** - CI test should now pass with the addition of the missing `SECURITY.md` file.
