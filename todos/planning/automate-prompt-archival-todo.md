**Date:** 2025-08-03
**Status:** PLANNING
**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Category:** Automation & Maintenance

## üéØ **Overview**

This task involves automating the archival of outdated prompts to maintain a clean and organized prompt system.

### **Background**
- Outdated prompts can clutter the system and make it difficult to find the most relevant prompts
- Manual archival is time-consuming and error-prone
- Automating the archival process will ensure that only current prompts are readily available
- The current system has 24 active prompts and 1 archived prompt

### **Objectives**
- [ ] Create a script to identify outdated prompts based on versioning and usage data
- [ ] Create a script to move outdated prompts to the `archived` directory
- [ ] Schedule the script to run automatically on a regular basis
- [ ] Implement safety checks to prevent accidental archival of important prompts

---

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Identification & Analysis**
- [ ] Create a script to identify outdated prompts based on versioning and usage data
- [ ] Implement criteria for determining when a prompt should be archived
- [ ] Add logging and reporting for archival decisions
- [ ] Create dry-run mode for testing archival logic

### **Phase 2: Archival Process**
- [ ] Create a script to move outdated prompts to the `archived` directory
- [ ] Implement proper file organization in archived directory
- [ ] Add metadata tracking for archived prompts
- [ ] Create archival history and rollback capabilities

### **Phase 3: Automation & Scheduling**
- [ ] Schedule the script to run automatically on a regular basis using cron or a similar tool
- [ ] Implement error handling and notification systems
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for archival failures
- [ ] Create archival reports and summaries

### **Phase 4: Integration & Validation**
- [ ] Integrate with existing prompt validation system
- [ ] Update prompt analytics to include archival data
- [ ] Test archival process with various prompt scenarios
- [ ] Validate that no important prompts are accidentally archived

## üöÄ **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Run archival script with dry-run mode
./scripts/archive-outdated-prompts.sh --dry-run

# Execute archival process
./scripts/archive-outdated-prompts.sh

# Check archival status
./scripts/archive-outdated-prompts.sh --status

# View archival history
./scripts/archive-outdated-prompts.sh --history
```

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### **Completion Criteria**
- [ ] Automated archival system is operational
- [ ] Outdated prompts are automatically identified and archived
- [ ] Archival process runs on schedule without errors
- [ ] Safety checks prevent accidental archival of important prompts

### **Quality Checks**
- [ ] No important prompts are accidentally archived
- [ ] Archival process maintains prompt system organization
- [ ] Archived prompts are properly organized and accessible
- [ ] System performance is not impacted by archival process

## üîó **Related Files**

### **Files to Modify**
- `scripts/archive-outdated-prompts.sh` - Main archival script
- `scripts/check-outdated-prompts.sh` - Enhance with archival capabilities
- `prompts/archived/` - Organize archived prompts
- `config/prompt-router-config.json` - Add archival configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risks and Considerations**

### **Potential Issues**
- Automated archival could accidentally archive important prompts
- Archival criteria may be too aggressive or too conservative
- Scheduling conflicts with other automated processes
- Performance impact during archival operations

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Implement multiple safety checks and confirmation steps
- Start with conservative archival criteria and adjust based on results
- Schedule archival during low-usage periods
- Monitor system performance during archival operations
