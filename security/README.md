## Contents

### Audit Reports (`audit-reports/`)
- **security-audit-report.md**: Initial security audit findings and recommendations
- **security-verification-complete.md**: Final security verification report before GitHub push

### Policies (`policies/`)
- **security.md**: Main security policy, vulnerability reporting, and best practices

## Security Workflow

1. **Pre-Release Audit**: Run security scans before any public release
2. **Policy Review**: Ensure all security policies are up to date
3. **Vulnerability Reporting**: Follow the process in `policies/security.md`
4. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic security reviews
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated security checks in GitHub Actions
6. **Release Sanitization**: Automatic personal information removal before releases
7. **Organization Standards**: Automated directory organization enforcement
8. **Quality Control**: Todo quality standards and dynamic symbol validation

## Quick Security Checks

```bash
# Automated pre-release sanitization
./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --dry-run

# Manual security checks
grep -r "api_key\|password\|token\|secret" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Check for dangerous commands
grep -r "sudo\|rm -rf\|chmod 777" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Check for personal information
grep -r "sap\|@gmail\|@yahoo" . --exclude-dir=.git
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Document all sudo usage in scripts
- Use relative paths instead of absolute paths
- Run pre-release sanitizer before all releases
- Regular security audits before releases
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- Use automated sanitization tools
