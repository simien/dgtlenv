## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of DgtlEnv seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the security vulnerability.
2. **DO** email your findings to [simienap@gmail.com](mailto:simienap@gmail.com) or create a private security advisory.
3. **DO** provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
   - Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** We will investigate and provide updates on our findings
- **Resolution:** We will work to fix the issue and provide a timeline for the fix
- **Disclosure:** We will coordinate with you on public disclosure of the vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will work with you to ensure the vulnerability is properly addressed
- We will coordinate the timing of public disclosure to minimize risk to users

### Security Best Practices

When using DgtlEnv, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated:**
   ```bash
   brew update && brew upgrade
   ```

2. **Use Secure Scripts:**
   - Always validate inputs in custom scripts
   - Use absolute paths for security-critical operations
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Monitor System Security:**
   ```bash
   ./ops/monitoring/swap-ssd-health.sh
   ```

4. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Review script permissions regularly
   - Monitor for unusual system activity
   - Keep system software updated

### Security Features

DgtlEnv includes several security-focused features:

- **Input Validation:** All scripts validate and sanitize inputs
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **Logging:** Secure logging practices (no sensitive data in logs)
- **Permissions:** Appropriate file and directory permissions
- **Monitoring:** System health monitoring to detect anomalies

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Shell Script Security:**
   - Scripts use parameterized commands to prevent injection
   - Input validation is implemented for all user inputs
   - Error messages don't expose sensitive information

2. **System Monitoring:**
   - Health checks don't expose sensitive system information
   - Metrics collection focuses on performance, not security data
   - Log files are properly secured

3. **PDF Processing:**
   - PDF conversion uses safe, validated tools
   - No executable content is processed
   - Output files are properly sanitized

### Security Contact

- **Email:** [simienap@gmail.com](mailto:simienap@gmail.com)
- **GitHub Security Advisories:** Use GitHub's built-in security advisory feature
- **PGP Key:** Available upon request for encrypted communications

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked as security releases in the changelog.

### Acknowledgments

We thank all security researchers and contributors who help keep DgtlEnv secure by reporting vulnerabilities and suggesting improvements.
