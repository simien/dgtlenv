# Docker Cleanup Script for macOS
# Frees up disk space by removing stopped containers, dangling images, unused volumes, and networks
#
# ðŸŽ¯ PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
# - Reduces Docker disk usage (typically 2-10GB)
# - Frees up memory used by stopped containers
# - Removes unused images that consume storage
# - Improves Docker performance and startup speed
# - BEFORE: High Docker disk usage, slow container operations
# - AFTER: Optimized Docker storage, faster container management
