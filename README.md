## 🎯 What is DgtlEnv?

**DgtlEnv** is a **personal experimental project** focused on improving my environment to run modern products. It contains explorations to manage this internally and my own personal interests in design, development, context systems, and processes. Built as a shell script toolkit for maximum simplicity and extensibility.
