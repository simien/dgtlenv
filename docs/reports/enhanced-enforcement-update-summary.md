# Enhanced Enforcement Script Update Summary - **DgtlEnv**

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Maintainer:** Simien Antonis-Parr

---

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes all documentation updates made to reflect the enhanced enforcement script with smart migration detection, which resolved the warnings about dynamic symbol items in completed todo files.

---

## üîß Technical Enhancement

### **Problem Solved**
- **Issue:** Enforcement script was showing warnings for dynamic symbol items that had already been migrated
- **Root Cause:** Script didn't distinguish between migrated and unmigrated items
- **Solution:** Enhanced logic to check for migration notes alongside dynamic symbols

### **Enhanced Logic**
```bash
# Before: Simple detection
if grep -q "\[[-~>!?]\]" "$todo_file"; then
    echo -e "${YELLOW}‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Items need migration${NC}"
fi

# After: Smart detection
if grep -q "\[[-~>!?]\]" "$todo_file" && ! grep -q "MIGRATED:" "$todo_file"; then
    echo -e "${YELLOW}‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Items need migration${NC}"
elif grep -q "\[[-~>!?]\]" "$todo_file" && grep -q "MIGRATED:" "$todo_file"; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}‚úÖ PASS: Items already migrated${NC}"
fi
```
