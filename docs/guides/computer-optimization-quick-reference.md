# Environment Optimization Quick Reference

**DgtlEnv Environment Optimization Tools** - Make your Mac run better

## 🧪 Test Your Environment

**Before optimizing, test your current setup:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite (non-interactive)
./tests/quick-test.sh --non-interactive

# Interactive Cursor IDE sync
./tests/interactive-cursor-sync.sh
```

## 🏥 System Health Check Card

### Quick Command
```bash
./ops/monitoring/swap-ssd-health.sh
```

### What It Does
- Monitors swap usage and warns about high memory pressure
- Checks SSD health and SMART status
- Detects active swapping that causes slowdowns
- Provides early warnings before system issues

### Performance Impact
- **BEFORE:** System lag, high swap activity, potential data loss
- **AFTER:** Proactive monitoring, early warning system, optimal performance

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Weekly health check
./ops/monitoring/swap-ssd-health.sh

# Check logs for historical data
cat ~/Library/Logs/swap-ssd-health.log

# Set up automated monitoring
crontab -e
# Add: 0 9 * * 1 /path/to/DgtlEnv/ops/monitoring/swap-ssd-health.sh
```

## 🧹 System Cleanup Card

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Homebrew cleanup (frees 1-5GB)
./ops/cleanup/brew-cleanup.sh

# Docker cleanup (frees 2-10GB)
./ops/cleanup/docker-cleanup.sh
```

### What They Do
- **Homebrew cleanup:** Removes old package versions and cache
- **Docker cleanup:** Removes stopped containers, unused images, volumes

### Performance Impact
- **BEFORE:** Limited disk space, slow operations
- **AFTER:** More free space, faster package/container management

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Monthly cleanup routine
./ops/cleanup/brew-cleanup.sh
./ops/cleanup/docker-cleanup.sh

# Check disk space before/after
df -h /
# Run cleanup
# df -h / (compare results)
```

## 🐳 Docker Optimization Card

### Quick Command
```bash
./ops/docker/docker-optimize.sh
```

### What It Does
- Monitors Docker resource usage
- Sets up Colima with optimal resource limits
- Provides warnings about resource hogging
- Optimizes container performance

### Performance Impact
- **BEFORE:** Docker resource hogging, slow system performance
- **AFTER:** Controlled Docker resources, optimal system performance

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Initial Docker optimization
./ops/docker/docker-optimize.sh

# Check Docker resource usage
docker system df

# Set up Colima with resource limits
colima start --cpu 2 --memory 2048 --disk 20
```

## 💻 Cursor IDE Optimization Card

### Quick Command
```bash
./scripts/sync-cursor-settings.sh
```

### What It Does
- Applies performance-optimized settings to Cursor IDE
- Reduces memory usage through optimized configuration
- Improves file watching and TypeScript server performance
- Disables unused extensions to save resources

### Performance Impact
- **BEFORE:** Cursor IDE lag, high memory usage, slow file operations
- **AFTER:** Optimized IDE performance, reduced memory usage, faster operations

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Apply optimized settings
./scripts/sync-cursor-settings.sh

# Check Cursor memory usage before/after
ps aux | grep Cursor

# Manual optimization steps
# 1. Open Cursor settings (Cmd + ,)
# 2. Set files.watcherExclude for large folders
# 3. Increase TypeScript server memory
# 4. Disable unused extensions
```

## 📊 Performance Tracking Card

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Capture baseline metrics
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh baseline

# Capture current metrics
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh current

# Compare before/after
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh compare

# View dashboard
./metrics/comprehensive-dashboard.sh dashboard
```

### What It Does
- Tracks system performance metrics over time
- Creates visual dashboards showing improvements
- Provides before/after comparisons
- Helps identify optimization opportunities

### Performance Impact
- **BEFORE:** No visibility into system performance trends
- **AFTER:** Clear metrics showing optimization effectiveness

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Complete optimization workflow
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh baseline
# ... run optimizations ...
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh current
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh compare

# View real-time status
./metrics/comprehensive-dashboard.sh status
```

---

## 🚀 Complete Optimization Workflow

### Step 1: Health Check
```bash
./ops/monitoring/swap-ssd-health.sh
```

### Step 2: Capture Baseline
```bash
./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh baseline
```

### Step 3: Run Optimizations
```bash
