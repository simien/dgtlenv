## 🔍 How to Use This History

### For Future Development
Reference historical decisions and solutions for informed development:

```bash
# Review key decisions
cat docs/development-history/decision-log/folder-naming-strategy.md

# Understand technical solutions
cat docs/development-history/technical-solutions/ci-cd-pipeline.md

# Learn from chat transcripts
cat docs/development-history/chat-transcripts/release-system-setup.md
```

### For New Team Members
Understand project context and evolution for effective contribution:

- Start with `project-evolution/` to understand the journey
- Review `decision-log/` for key architectural decisions
- Study `technical-solutions/` for implementation details

### For Project Maintenance
Use historical context for troubleshooting and improvements:

- Reference `chat-transcripts/` for context on specific features
- Use `decision-log/` to understand why certain choices were made
- Consult `technical-solutions/` for troubleshooting

## 📝 Export Process

### Manual Export Steps
Follow these steps to maintain comprehensive project history:

1. **Chat Transcripts**: Copy conversation content from Cursor
2. **Decision Log**: Document key decisions and rationale
