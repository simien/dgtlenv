# Cleanup & Reorganization Standards

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE STANDARDS
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent organization and cleanup processes

---

## 🎯 **Core Principles**

> **Organization sophistication** - Systematic standards for consistent project structure

### **1. Directory Organization Standards**
> **Structural refinement** - Logical organization principles for optimal navigation

- **No files in root directories** unless they are README files or essential configuration
- **Logical grouping** by content type and purpose
- **Consistent naming** conventions across all directories
- **README files** in every directory explaining purpose and contents

### **2. File Placement Rules**
> **Logical organization** - Systematic file placement for optimal structure

- **Documentation files** → `docs/` with appropriate subdirectories
- **Reports and assessments** → `docs/reports/`
- **Process documentation** → `docs/workflows/`
- **Setup guides** → `docs/setup/`
- **Style guides** → `docs/style/`
- **Hardware specs** → `docs/setup/hardware-specs/`
- **Development history** → `docs/development-history/`

### **3. Cleanup Process Standards**
> **Maintenance orchestration** - Systematic cleanup procedures for optimal performance

- **Backup files** → `config/backups/` or remove entirely
- **System files** (`.DS_Store`) → Remove completely
- **Temporary files** → Remove completely
- **Duplicate content** → Consolidate or remove

## 📋 **Process Checklist**

> **Quality assurance** - Systematic process for safe and effective reorganization

### **Before Starting Any Reorganization**
> **Preparation phase** - Essential steps before beginning reorganization

- [ ] **Create backup** of current state
- [ ] **Commit current state** to git
- [ ] **Document the plan** in a todo file
- [ ] **Review existing structure** to understand current organization
- [ ] **Identify target directories** for moved files

### **During Reorganization**
> **Execution phase** - Systematic approach to reorganization

- [ ] **Create new directories** first
- [ ] **Add README files** to new directories
- [ ] **Move files by logical groups** (not one by one)
- [ ] **Test functionality** after each group
- [ ] **Update cross-references** and links
- [ ] **Remove backup files** and system files

### **After Reorganization**
> **Validation phase** - Quality assurance and documentation updates

- [ ] **Verify all functionality** works correctly
- [ ] **Update main README** files with new structure
- [ ] **Test all scripts** and workflows
- [ ] **Commit changes** with descriptive messages
- [ ] **Create summary report** in appropriate directory

## 📁 **Directory Structure Standards**

### **Required Directories**
> **Directory Architecture** - Comprehensive directory structure for optimal organization

### **Prohibited in Root Directories**
- ❌ **Backup files** (`.bak`, `.backup`)
- ❌ **System files** (`.DS_Store`)
- ❌ **Temporary files**
- ❌ **Scattered documentation** (should be in appropriate subdirectories)
- ❌ **Process summaries** (should be in `docs/reports/`)

### **Todo Quality Control Standards**
- ✅ **Completed todos** must have ALL checkboxes marked `[x]`
- ✅ **Completed todos** must show "✅ COMPLETED" status
- ✅ **Completed todos** must include completion date
- ✅ **No completed todo** can have unchecked `[ ]` boxes
- ✅ **Dynamic symbols** with required outcome communication:
  - `[x]` - Completed
  - `[-]` - Future/Optional → Must append: `[-] Original task - Future/Optional: [reason or target todo]`
  - `[~]` - In Progress → Must append: `[~] Original task - In Progress: [current status]`
  - `[>]` - Deferred/Moved → Must append: `[>] Original task - Deferred to: [target todo file]` or `[>] Original task - Moved to: [target todo file]`
  - `[!]` - Blocked → Must append: `[!] Original task - Blocked: [reason or dependency]`
  - `[?]` - Cancelled → Must append: `[?] Original task - Cancelled: [reason]`

### **Todo Migration Workflow**
- ✅ **Future/Optional tasks** must be moved to `todos/planning/` or `todos/active/`
- ✅ **In Progress tasks** must be moved to `todos/active/`
- ✅ **Deferred tasks** must be moved to the specified target todo file
- ✅ **Blocked tasks** must be moved to `todos/active/` with blocker documentation
- ✅ **Cancelled tasks** can remain in completed with cancellation reason
- ✅ **Migration must include timestamps** and source file reference
- ✅ **Target todo files** must follow naming conventions: `[category]-[purpose]-todo.md`

### **Migration Process**
```bash
# Run migration script
./scripts/migrate-todo-items.sh

# Check what would be migrated
./scripts/migrate-todo-items.sh --dry-run

# Review migration results
cat logs/todo-migration-*.log

# Check organization standards (now with smart migration detection)
./scripts/enforce-organization-standards.sh
```

### **Migration Rules**
- **[-] Future/Optional** → Moved to `todos/planning/[category]-todo.md`
- **[~] In Progress** → Moved to `todos/active/[category]-todo.md`
- **[>] Deferred** → Moved to `todos/active/[category]-todo.md`
- **[!] Blocked** → Moved to `todos/active/[category]-todo.md`
- **[?] Cancelled** → Remains in completed with migration note

### **Smart Migration Detection**
The enforcement script now semantically detects migration status:
- **Items with migration notes** → Recognized as already migrated (PASS)
- **Items without migration notes** → Flagged for migration (WARNING)
- **Maintains audit trail** → Migration notes preserve historical context

5. **Schedule implementation** - Allow proper resource allocation and prioritization

#### **Why This Approach:**
- ✅ **Maintains consistency** with existing workflow
- ✅ **Ensures proper documentation** and tracking
- ✅ **Enables structured planning** and quality control
- ✅ **Integrates with migration** and validation systems
- ✅ **Allows for proper resource management** and scheduling

#### **Examples of Issues That Require Todos:**
- Logging system organization
- Directory structure improvements
- Script path updates
- Documentation gaps
- Quality control enhancements
- Process workflow improvements
- Todo metrics dashboard updates
- progress chart maintenance

**Next Review:** Monthly standards review and update as needed
