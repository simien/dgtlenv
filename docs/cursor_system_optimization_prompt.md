# System Optimization Prompt for Cursor AI

## Context
I'm using a MacBook Pro 2015 running macOS 12.7.6 Monterey and need to optimize my development environment for running Cursor IDE alongside Docker, browsers, and background services efficiently. Please help me configure this system for optimal performance.

## Current Setup
- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro 2015 (likely 8-16GB RAM, dual/quad-core Intel processor)
- **OS**: macOS 12.7.6 Monterey
- **Primary Development Tools**: Cursor IDE, Docker Desktop
- **Additional Requirements**: Web browsers, file syncing services, background tasks

## Optimization Goals
Please provide specific recommendations for:

### 1. Resource Management
- Memory allocation strategies for Cursor vs Docker vs other applications
- CPU priority management for development workflows
- Disk space optimization techniques for Docker images and containers
- SSD health preservation on older hardware

### 2. Docker Configuration
- Optimal Docker Desktop settings for limited resources
- Memory and CPU limits for containers
- Storage driver recommendations for macOS
- Best practices for image cleanup and management
- Alternative lightweight Docker solutions (Colima, Podman, etc.)

### 3. Cursor IDE Optimization
- Performance settings and configurations
- Extensions management for resource efficiency
- TypeScript/language server optimization
- Workspace and project organization for faster loading

### 4. System-Level Tweaks
- macOS Monterey performance optimizations
- Background app management strategies
- File system optimizations (APFS tuning)
- Network configuration for development tools
- Energy management for sustained performance

### 5. Workflow Optimization
- Efficient development container patterns
- Hot-reload and file watching optimizations
- Browser resource management during development
- File syncing service configuration (Dropbox, iCloud, etc.)

### 6. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Tools for monitoring system performance
- Automated cleanup scripts and maintenance routines
- Early warning systems for resource exhaustion
- Performance profiling techniques

## Specific Challenges to Address
- Preventing thermal throttling during intensive development sessions
- Managing swap usage to avoid SSD wear
- Balancing Docker resource allocation with IDE responsiveness
- Optimizing for both coding and container development workflows
- Maintaining system responsiveness when running multiple development servers

## Expected Output Format
Please provide:
1. **Immediate Actions**: Quick wins I can implement today
2. **Configuration Files**: Specific settings and config snippets
3. **Shell Scripts**: Automation for common optimization tasks
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Commands and tools for ongoing performance tracking
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions for this hardware/OS combination

Focus on practical, tested solutions that account for the hardware limitations of a 2015 MacBook Pro while maximizing development productivity.
